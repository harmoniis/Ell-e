## Design considerations

- low cost ($20K - $15K)
- high autonomy (+4h normal load)
- easy change of batteries
- modularity and reusability of actuators
- easy to build and repair
- low center of mass
- silent and efficient actuation
- manufacturable as a toy
- avoid anthropomorphisation

## Battery
![Wheels](/wheels.jpeg)
Batteries are located inside the rimms of the wheels and are very easy to replace. Low center of mass is achieved by placing the batteries as low as possible. All other current concepts have batteries on the chest or back and very small. You never hear them to talk about autonomy because is probably less than 20 - 30 minutes at normal load.

Inside wheels we can achive 20kWh capacity.
